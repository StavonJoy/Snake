# Snake

A simple snake game, built off of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21eSpMtJwrc). This uses Javascript, HTML Canvas, Google Fonts, and Bootstrap Icons. I added a high score function, a directional button display for mobile devices, and some styling. I'll be making it even more mobile responsive and adding more styling soon!

## Updates
Updated on 1/4/20 to add a game over alert and wall collisions. No more sneaking around the back to safety!
